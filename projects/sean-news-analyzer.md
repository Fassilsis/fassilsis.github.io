## Getting Started

This project was born during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, the news was overwhelming and emotionally charged. I wanted to create a tool to help users filter news headlines by sentiment and emotion, making it easier to navigate and understand the tone behind the headlines. This project was my first deep dive into natural language processing (NLP) and introduced me to practical applications of sentiment analysis.

### Why I Built This

I aimed to explore how different NLP models could be combined to provide meaningful insights into news content. By using sentiment and emotion detection, I wanted to give users a way to select news stories that matched or balanced their mood, helping them consume information more mindfully. The project also helped me learn the mechanics of text processing and deploying APIs for real-time applications.

### What I Did

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Collection         | Gathered news headlines from various sources during the pandemic period.                     |
| Text Preprocessing      | Cleaned and prepared text data by removing noise, normalizing case, and tokenizing.          |
| Sentiment & Emotion Models | Implemented rule-based NLP tools like TextBlob and Vader to analyze sentiment polarity and emotion scores. |
| API Development        | Built a Flask-based API to expose the sentiment and emotion analysis for easy integration.    |
| Testing & Validation   | Evaluated model outputs for accuracy and usefulness in classifying news tone.                 |

### What I Learned

This project introduced me to natural language processing in a very hands-on way. I gained practical experience with popular sentiment analysis tools and learned the challenges of working with noisy, real-world text data. Building the API helped me understand how to deploy machine learning models in applications that users can interact with directly. Above all, it showed me how NLP can be used to make everyday tasks, like reading the news, more manageable and meaningful.
