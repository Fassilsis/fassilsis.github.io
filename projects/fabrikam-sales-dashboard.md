## Getting Started

Starting out in data analytics involves more than learning tools. It is about using those tools to solve real business problems. That was the goal behind this project. I set out to build a complete Power BI dashboard that simulates a real-world sales environment.

To do this, I worked with a dataset from Fabrikam. This is a fictional electronics company created by Microsoft for training purposes. Because the data is based on realistic business scenarios, I was able to explore freely without dealing with privacy issues or missing information.with realistic data, I had the freedom to dig into business questions without any real-world restrictions.

## Why This Project?

I wanted to go beyond tutorials and challenge myself with a project that reflects real business challenges. These include understanding sales performance, analyzing pricing strategies, and exploring geographic trends.

This dashboard became a way to practice those skills in a hands-on way. It allowed me to create an interactive report that tells a story from the national level down to individual products. My focus was not only on making the visuals look good. It was also about making the data clear, meaningful, and actionable.

## What the report Covers

The final report is made up of four main pages. Each one is designed to answer specific business questions.

Executive Summary: This is the big-picture view. Think total revenue, units sold, average prices, and how sales trend over time. I added a market share breakdown by manufacturer and a quick look at regional performance to give the “here’s how we’re doing” snapshot.

Product & Pricing: Here, I dug into how actual prices stack up against suggested retail prices. I also looked at which customer groups love discounts and how revenue splits across product categories. It’s the nitty-gritty of what’s selling and why.

Geographic & Regional Analysis: This page maps out sales by state, region, and top-performing cities. It’s cool to see how trends shift across locations—like why one region’s killing it while another’s lagging.

Manufacturer & Supplier Insights: This dives into supplier performance—revenue, discount patterns, and which products are flying off the shelves. It’s all about understanding who’s driving the numbers.

## How I Built It

I used Power BI Desktop for the whole thing. Power Query was a lifesaver for cleaning up the raw data—dealing with weird formatting and null values. I leaned on DAX to whip up custom KPIs, like year-over-year growth and profit margins, which helped bring the data to life. 

To make the dashboard interactive, I added slicers and bookmarks so users could filter and drill down easily. It’s like giving them a steering wheel to explore the data themselves.

## What I Learned

This project gave me the chance to improve a number of important skills. I practiced turning complex business questions into clear, visual answers. I focused on designing a dashboard that delivers insight without being difficult to navigate.

Another key part of the project was learning how to model relationships between products, locations, and sales data. This is an essential skill in any real-world analytics job. Most of all, the experience helped me grow in my ability to create dashboards that are both functional and easy to understand.
