## Getting Started

Starting out in data analytics involves more than learning tools. It is about using those tools to solve real business problems. That was the goal behind this project. I set out to build a complete Power BI dashboard that simulates a real-world sales environment.

To do this, I worked with a dataset from Fabrikam. This is a fictional electronics company created by Microsoft for training purposes. Because the data is based on realistic business scenarios, I was able to explore freely without dealing with privacy issues or missing information.with realistic data, I had the freedom to dig into business questions without any real-world restrictions.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to go beyond tutorials and challenge myself with a project that reflects real business challenges. These include understanding sales performance, analyzing pricing strategies, and exploring geographic trends.

This dashboard became a way to practice those skills in a hands-on way. It allowed me to create an interactive report that tells a story from the national level down to individual products. My focus was not only on making the visuals look good. It was also about making the data clear, meaningful, and actionable.

## About the Dataset

I wanted to go beyond tutorials and challenge myself with a project that reflects real business challenges. These include understanding sales performance, analyzing pricing strategies, and exploring geographic trends.

This dashboard became a way to practice those skills in a hands-on way. It allowed me to create an interactive report that tells a story from the national level down to individual products. My focus was not only on making the visuals look good. It was also about making the data clear, meaningful, and actionable.

## What the report Covers

The final report is made up of four main pages. Each one is designed to answer specific business questions.

The first page, called Executive Summary, gives an overview of key metrics. It includes total revenue, units sold, average prices, and sales trends over time. It also highlights market share by manufacturer and shows a summary of regional performance.

The second page is Product and Pricing. This section compares actual prices to the manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail prices. It also explores which customer segments rely most on discounts and breaks down revenue by product category.

The Geographic and Regional Analysis page focuses on sales performance by location. It shows revenue by state and region, top-performing cities, and how sales trends vary across areas.

The final page is Manufacturer and Supplier Insights page. This section looks at how each supplier contributes to performance. It covers revenue and discount patterns, best-selling products, and overall supplier impact..

## Tools and Techniques

This project was built entirely in Power BI Desktop. I used DAX formulas to create custom KPIs and to analyze trends over time. Power Query helped me clean and prepare the raw data before building the report.

To make the dashboard interactive, I used bookmarks and slicers. These tools allow users to filter and explore the data in a flexible way.

## What I Learned

This project gave me the chance to improve a number of important skills. I practiced turning complex business questions into clear, visual answers. I focused on designing a dashboard that delivers insight without being difficult to navigate.

Another key part of the project was learning how to model relationships between products, locations, and sales data. This is an essential skill in any real-world analytics job. Most of all, the experience helped me grow in my ability to create dashboards that are both functional and easy to understand.
