## Getting Started

This project was one of my first steps into data science. I wanted a practical way to learn Python and data analysis basics. The Titanic dataset was perfect. It is a classic problem with real-world meaning.

By cleaning, exploring, and modeling the data, I learned how to handle messy data and uncover insights. This project laid the foundation for my data skills today.

## Why This Project?

The Titanic dataset is more than a machine learning example. It tells a human story. I wanted to practice important skills like data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

My goal was to understand what factors affected survival and to build a model that could predict outcomes.


## How I Built It

| Step                   | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Cleaning**       | Filled missing ages with medians grouped by passenger class and gender. Converted categories to numeric. |
| **Exploratory Analysis**| Visualized survival by gender, class, age, and embarkation point to identify key features.       |
| **Feature Engineering** | Created family size and extracted titles from names to capture social status.                    |
| **Modeling**            | Tested logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVM, KNN, and boosting models.      |
| **Ensemble Voting**     | Combined models using a voting classifier to improve accuracy and balance predictions.           |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning**| Used grid search and repeated cross-validation to optimize model parameters.                     |
| **Final Results**       | Achieved 91% accuracy on training data; 80.4% on test data, ranking in the top 4% on Kaggle.     |


## ## What I Took Away

This project taught me:

- How to clean and prepare data carefully.  
- The importance of exploratory analysis to understand data.  
- How feature engineering can improve models.  
- That combining models can boost performance.  
- The value of cross-validation and tuning to avoid overfitting.

It also strengthened my skills with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

The Titanic project gave me hands-on experience with a full data science workflow. It helped me move from raw data to a strong predictive model. This case study remains a key part of my portfolio and shows my ability to turn data into insights.
